  <h2>Packages provided by Tech Nerds:</h2>
  <h3>1) Online Resume</h3>
  <p>Online resumes are the new way to apply for employment. The Internet now plays an integral role in how people search for jobs, as well as how employers and companies find appropriate candidates. According to some resume writing experts, traditional resumes, such as chronological resumes or functional resumes, are outdated.</p>
  <p>Make your resume stand out:</p>
  <p>Ultimately though, the key factor in all resume writing is to have an impressive, solid, and error-free resume that reflects your skills and experiences. Having a resume that markets you as the ideal candidate for the job will prove to be the difference between getting a job or not.

    Because of this, it's important to check your resume carefully, and our resume editing experts are more than happy to provide some extra help to revamp and improve your resume, bringing you one step closer to landing your dream job.</p>
